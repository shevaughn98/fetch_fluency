### JavaScript Higher Order Methods + Fetch API

## Directions
For the following questions, use the [JSON Placeholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)

1. Write a function, `logPost`, that takes a post `id` and logs the post to the console in the following format:
  ```
  Title: qui est esse
  Post: est rerum tempore...
  ```

2. Write a function, `logUsers`, that logs all the names of the 10 users to the console. (Just their first and last name)

3. Write a function, `getBizUsers`, that logs an array of users that have email addresses that end in ".biz".

4. Write a function, `longestPost`, that logs the longest post to the console.

5. This database has 200 `todos`. Write a function called `getCompletedTasks` that logs an array of all of the completed tasks.

6. Write a function, `displayPhotos`, that displays a grid of 9 photos in the browser.

7. **Challenge**: Write a function, `findClosest`, that logs the user that is geographically closest to where you are currently sitting.

8. **CHALLENGE Challenge**: Modify `findClosest` so that it takes a city as an argument and logs the user that is closest to that city.

9. Write a function, `numOfLongPosts`, that logs the number of posts that are longer than 20 words.

10. Write a function, `getUserFromPost`. This function takes post title as a parameter and logs the user who created that post.
